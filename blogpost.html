<p>Today technology seems to be everywhere. People claim that technology will start taking over people's daily lives. That technolohy is now capable of interpeting human knowlege. However, is this really ethical? Can humans and robots really share the same earth? I say that the chances of robots taking over our jobs are really low.</p>

 	<h2> An Adult's perspective on Technology </h2>

	<p> In this interview, I spoke to a teacher that goes to my school. This teacher; Adam, teaches physics and enjoys "messing around" with technology. </p>

 	<p>Me: How old were you when you got your first computer </p>

 	<p>Adam: 17, in like 2007 </p> 

 	<p>Me: What was your favorite piece of technology when you were growing up? </p>

 	<p>Adam: The playstation portable , because it had hacks and custom things, it was the coolest thing. </p>

 	<p> Me: How has technology changed over your lifetime? </p>

 	<p>Adam: Now it's more user friendly, but less flexable, like you can only do what apple says you can do. It's generally good , technology is more accessable" </p>
	
	<p> Me: What is your greatest hope for technology in the future? </p> 

 	<p>Adam: To become more like responsible , nowadays technology is trying to take advange of human phychology to use their apps.</p>

	<p>Me: What is your greatest fear for technology in the future? </p>

	<p>Adam: Well,technology turns you into total zombies.</p>

	<p>Me:What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology? </p>

	<p>Adam: Don't be afraid to mess with technology , get out of your confort zone, try different sysyems.</p>

	<p>Me: What do you think is the coolest technology at the moment? </p> 

	<p>Adam: Space flight because so much technology has come through space programming , communication is possible bc of satallite. </p>
